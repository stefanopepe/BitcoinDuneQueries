-- Smoke Test: Lending Entity Loop Storyboard
-- Description: Validates that per-entity time-ordered action traces
--              can be computed with running collateral/debt totals.
--              Focuses on multi-protocol entities using Aave V3
--              and Morpho Blue stablecoin events from the last 14 days.
