-- Smoke Test: Lending Loop Collateral Profile
-- Description: Validates that cross-protocol flows can be joined
--              with collateral positions to determine what backs
--              stablecoin borrows. Tests collateral categorization
--              (BTC vs ETH vs LST) and implied leverage calculation.
--              Uses events from the last 14 days.
