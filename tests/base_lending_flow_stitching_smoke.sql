-- Smoke Test: Lending Flow Stitching
-- Description: Validates cross-protocol flow detection by checking
--              for same-tx borrow->supply patterns across protocols.
--              Uses stablecoin-filtered events from the last 30 days.
--              Covers Aave V3, Morpho Blue, Compound V3, Compound V2.
